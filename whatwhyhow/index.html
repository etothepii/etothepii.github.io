            <h2>What?</h2>
            <p class="fragment">A series of courses and materials to encourage young people to take up computer programming.</p>
            <p class="fragment">The key features of our programmes will be:</p>
            <ul>
              <li class="fragment">Inspiring Passion</li>
              <li class="fragment">Interesting Projects</li>
              <li class="fragment">Industry Tools</li>
            </ul>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h2>Inspire Passion</h2>
            <p class="fragment">We are creating a rod for our own backs here.</p>
            <p class="fragment">Important because computer programming is most successfully learned through practice.</p>
            <p class="fragment">Practice requires self motivation which is much easier to do if one is passionate.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h2>Interesting Projects</h2>
            <p class="fragment">Holding the interest of participants will be most easily achieved if our projects are interesting.</p>
            <p class="fragment">We intend to start with a website, as it is the quickest way to get something on screen.</p>
            <p class="fragment">In our first course those who don't have their own idea, will build a simple twitter clone, with Python.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h2>Industry Tools</h2>
            <p class="fragment">We are passionate about sharing and developing skills which are of real practical use.</p>
            <p class="fragment">Consequently we intend to use real industry tools, all of which will be open-source.</p>
            <p class="fragment">Successful participants will be able to talk about their project with a computer programmer as a peer.</p>
          </section>
        </section>
        <section>
          <section>
            <h2>Why?</h2>
            <p class="fragment">Sharing knowledge and skills is almost always an unfettered good.</p>
            <p class="fragment">However, there are specific issues which are our priorities.</p>
            <ul>
              <li class="fragment">Qualification Gap</li>
              <li class="fragment">Gender Imbalance</li>
              <li class="fragment">Community Outreach</li>
            </ul>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h2>Qualification Gap</h2>
            <p class="fragment">There is currently no universally recognized computer related qualification which
              demonstrates an ability to write computer programmes.</p>
            <p class="fragment">Websites such as Stack Overflow and GitHub make it possible to objectively demonstrate
              the depth, breadth and quality of your knowledge to the detriment of those who don't know of their
              importance.</p>
            <p class="fragment">Without encouragement and support from knowledgeable members of the community these
              sites, tools and systems can be daunting.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h2>Gender Imbalance</h2>
            <p class="fragment">Anecdotal evidence suggests that their are very few female computer programmers in
              Britain. Our team contains none, neither did the much larger team before that and my father could count
              on the fingers of his left hand the number of female programmers he has worked with.</p>
            <p class="fragment">By demonstrating computer programming in a sociable and supportive environment we hope
              to encourage girls to take an interest in the subject.</p>
            <p class="fragment">If we are to achieve our target of a 50-50 gender balance within our courses we will
              likely need to enact strongly discriminatory selection bias in favour of female applicants.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h2>Community Outreach</h2>
            <p class="fragment">Tower Hamlets, and its neighbouring inner London boroughs, are amongst some of the most
              deprieved in Britain.</p>
            <p class="fragment">Canary Wharf is a center of relatively fantastically well paying jobs few of which are
              gained by local people.</p>
            <p class="fragment">Programming is one of the few professions where it really doesn't matter how you speak,
              or who you know. If we can impart the skills and enthusiasm to local people now in 6 to 10 years time
            these students could be candidates for the various Canary Wharf graduate and apprenticeship programmes.</p>

            <h2>How?</h2>
            <p class="fragment">Running this programme will require substantial effort and planning on our part.</p>
            <p class="fragment">The key areas we have considered are:</p>
            <ul>
              <li class="fragment">Location</li>
              <li class="fragment">Communication</li>
              <li class="fragment">Mistakes</li>
            </ul>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h2>Location</h2>
            <p class="fragment">Barclays have kindly offered us the use of the computer labs in their Training centre to
              run our courses.</p>
            <p class="fragment">Initially we intend to have 12 students as we believe the 6:1 ratio this will create is
              sufficient to be manageable with our limited teaching experience.</p>
            <p class="fragment">Courses will typically run for either 6, 8 or 12 sessions held over consecutive weeks
              during academic term time with a large component of self study.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h2>Communication</h2>
            <p class="fragment">We plan to keep a blog of our experiences to provide encouragement and advice to others
              who want to run a similar programme.</p>
            <p class="fragment">Reveal.js and GitHub Pages will allow us to publish all the slideshows we will use as
              teaching aides in easily editable and reusable way.</p>
            <p class="fragment">Github will allow us to open source all our projects with clear checkpoints, continuous
              improvement and complete transparency.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h2>Mistakes</h2>
            <p class="fragment">We are keen to begin this journey and understand that this enthusiasm is likely to lead
              to some mistakes.</p>
            <p class="fragment">Mistakes should not be feared, but embraced as a learning experience, planning is
              important but too much planning can lead to inertia.</p>
            <p class="fragment">The number of variables is such that it would be impossible to control for them all,
              sufficiently documented trial and error will likely lead to the best long term results.</p>
