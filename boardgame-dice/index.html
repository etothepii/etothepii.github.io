  <h1 class="display-4">Boardgame Dice</h1>
  <p class="lead">This is a simple website that refers to the free iOS app &quot;boardgame dice&quot; it is designed to make playing board games that use two regular size sided dice a little easier.</p>
  <p>During many boardgames, such as the Settlers of Catan, it can be annoying when an unlikely number such as 2, or 12 comes up a number of times. Thus the full gammut of 36 possible options are rolled in advance and then shown one at a time until 31 have been shewn. At which point the process will repeat with a new randomised set of rolls.</p>
  <p>The game will additionally keep track of who's turn it is to play.</p>
  <p>If you enable the &quot;Voice Control&quot; (Settings &gt; Accessibility &gt; Voice Control &gt; Voice Control) then you will able to issue the voice command &quot;Press Roll&quot;. To cause the next roll to occur.</p>
  <p><b>Be aware that the the Voice Control involves your phone listening to everything so you might want to switch this off when not using the boardgame dice.</b></p>
